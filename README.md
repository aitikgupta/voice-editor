# Type by Voice Instructions
This Project enables the user to type using voice commands without requiring to use keyboard at all.

Please feel free to create Issues if you find a bug somewhere or send a Pull Request if you wish to improve the existing code/add a new feature. :)

## Setup

Clone the project locally.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/incubateindia/voice-editor.git
```

Change directory to folder voice-editor

```sh
$ cd voice-editor
```

## Usage
You can create pull request for task modules related to planning and research by keeping your idea files inside `plans/` directory. Please make sure to include task number in your file name.

For other tasks, keep your codes inside `modules/` directory before creating the pull request and include task number somewhere in the file name.

Then we can integrate different modules into a working application.
